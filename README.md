# parallax-effect
<p>
  The whole game is of background-positon:center; which will center the image for any div
  then background-size: cover; comes into the play and it covers the whole screen with the best fit 
  resolution, then background-attachment: fixed; is the main player here which makes it fixed to the background and it gives an effect of parallax effect.
